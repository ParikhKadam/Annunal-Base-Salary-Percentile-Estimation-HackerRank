# Annunal-Base-Salary-Percentile-Estimation-HackerRank
The Annual Base Salary Percentile Estimation Challenge by HackerRank


## Introduction

The Occupational Employment and Wage Statistics (OEWS) program produces employment and wage estimates annually for nearly 800 occupations. These estimates are available for the nation as a whole, for individual states, and for metropolitan and nonmetropolitan areas; national occupational estimates for specific industries are also available.

## Problem

The data used in this problem is a subset of the OEWS data, which include the 10-th percentile, 25-th percentile, 50-th percentile (a.k.a median), 75-th percentile, and 90-th percentile of the annual salary of a given combination of states, industries, and occupations.

One needs to use the data in _train.csv_ to train a machine learning model to predict the 10-th, 25-th, 50-th, 75-th and 90-th percentiles of the given combinations in _submission.csv_.

## Data

### Independent Variables

There are three independent variable columns:
- PRIM_STATE
- NAICS_TITLE
- OCC_TITLE

indicating the state, industry, and occupation.

NOTE:
- In the _PRIM_STATE_ variable, each category indicates a state postal abbreviation (like "_CA_", "_TX_", etc.) or "_U.S_" as the whole United States. When _PRIM_STATE_ is "_U.S_", it means the percentiles are aggregated across all the states.
- In thes _NAICS_TITLE_, each category indicates an industry sector name (like "_Retail Trade_", "_Manufacturing_") or "_Cross-industry_". When _NAICS_TITLE_ is "_Cross-industry_", it means the percentiles are aggregated across all the industries.

### Target Variables

There are 5 dependent (target) variable columns:
- A_PCT10
- A_PCT25
- A_MEDIAN
- A_PCT75
- A_PCT90

indicating the 10-th percentile, 25-th percentile, median, 75-th percentile, 90-th percentile of the annual base salary given the state, industry, and occupation information.

**IMPORTANT**: the percentiles should follow an increasing order. Namely, the 10-th percentile is less than (<) the 25-th percentile, the 25-th percentile is less than (<) the 50-th percentile, etc.

## Deliverables

### Submit a Well commented Jupyter Notebook

Explore the data, make visualizations, and generate new features if required. Make appropriate plots, annotate the notebook with markdowns and explain necessary inferences. A person should be able to read the notebook and understand the steps taken as well as the reasoning behind them. The solution will be graded on the basis of the usage of effective visualizations to convey the analysis and the modeling process.


### Submit _submission.csv_

In the given _submission.csv_, values in the "A_PCT10", "A_PCT25", "A_MEDIAN", "A_PCT75", and "A_PCT90" columns are constants, and you need to replace them with your model predictions.

**IMPORTANT**:
- please do not change the header given in _submission.csv_, or your predictions may not be evaluated correctly.
- Your Jupyter Notebook should be able to generate your submitted predictions.



## Evaluation Metric

The model performance is evaluated by the mean normalized weighted absolute error (MNWAE) defined as the following:
$$ MNWAE = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \sum_{j \in \{10, 25, 50, 75, 90\}} w_j \times \frac{|y_{i,j}-z_{i,j}|}{z_{i,j}}$$
where $y_{i,j}$ and $z_{i,j}$ are the model estimation and the ground truth of the $i$-th row and $j$-th percentile, and
$$ w_{10} = w_{90} = 0.1, $$
$$ w_{25} = w_{75} = 0.2, $$
$$ w_{50} = 0.4 $$

For example, if

actual percentiles = [10000, 30000, 60000, 80000, 100000],

predicted percentiles = [11000, 33000, 54000, 88000, 120000],

normalized weighted absolute error = 0.1*|11000-10000|/10000+0.2*|33000-30000|/30000+0.4*|54000-60000|/60000+0.2*|88000-80000|/80000+0.1*|120000-100000|/100000 = 0.11

**IMPORTANT**: if the predicted percentiles in any row do not follow an increasing order, all the predictions will be considered as invalid.
